            <p>NNB treat consultants as a part of the family. For us, we value nothing more thant the relationship we build with you.
              Each year, consultants are invited to participate on two funded-trips by NNB so each consultant can continue to grow their professionalism, empower their mission statements, and grow to be stronger human beings. On top of that, NNB provides monthly teleconference calls to keep consultants up-to-date on industry news, ingredient training, and other updates. The total amount of these teleconferences can cumulate to up to 24 hours each year.
              For those who’d like to take their career to the next level, NNB is here to offer full-on support. As your consultant career progresses, you will be exposed to different opportunities, such as media events, interviews, and attending major conferences.
